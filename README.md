## Hi there 👋 * *performs NPC wave* *
I'm Ethan, just another guy you perhaps come to scroll across in your daily adventures.
I make dumb projects (but I don't tell myself that 😄).<br>

I'm a bit into cars, and my favourite is the Corvette Stingray, even though my Profile Picture is a McLaren Senna (I can't be bothered changing it😴)<br><br>
Here are some stats to prove that I'm pretty bad at coding. (TODO: Regret adding this)<br><br>
